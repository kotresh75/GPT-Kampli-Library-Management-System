00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,590
Hello! In this video, we will see how to

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,040
install the Library Management System

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,490
on your Windows computer,

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,940
step by step.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,389
This software is specially developed for

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,227
the library of Government Polytechnic,

7
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,064
Kampli. The entire process is

8
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,514
very simple and takes only

9
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:21,180
about 5 minutes. First, go to

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,871
our GitHub releases page —

11
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:26,562
the link is provided in the description.

12
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,715
In the Assets section, you'll see the GPTK Library Manager

13
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:31,407
Setup installer file.

14
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,098
Here, EXE, MSI,

15
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:36,789
and Portable versions are

16
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,480
also available. Let's download the EXE installer

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,425
now. The download is

18
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,134
about 90 MB. Depending on your internet

19
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:47,302
speed, it may take a couple

20
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:49,469
of minutes. After the download is complete,

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,178
double-click the installer file

22
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,887
to start the installation. If a SmartScreen

23
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,055
warning appears, don't worry.

24
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,764
This is a standard warning for new applications —

25
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,931
our software is completely safe. Click "More info",

26
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,624
then click "Run anyway".

27
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:07,207
The installer welcome page

28
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:09,789
will appear. Click "Next" to continue. Now

29
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:12,371
choose who to install for —

30
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,954
there are two options here. "Anyone who uses this

31
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:17,536
computer" means all users of this PC,

32
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,118
and "Only for me" means just

33
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:22,701
the current user. Select "Only for me"

34
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,650
and click "Next". This

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,420
page shows where the application will be installed.

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,635
The default location is "Program Files".

37
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:32,850
No need to change it.

38
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,066
Leave it as default. To start the installation,

39
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:37,835
click the "Install" button. The installer

40
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,604
is now extracting the application files.

41
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:42,819
This includes the

42
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,588
Electron runtime, React frontend, Node.js backend,

43
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,432
and the SQLite database engine.

44
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:51,137
It usually takes 30 seconds to 1

45
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,841
minute. Please do not close this window.

46
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,463
Installation completed

47
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,627
successfully! Desktop and Start Menu

48
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:00,331
shortcuts have also been created. Make sure

49
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,494
"Run GPTK Library Manager" is checked,

50
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,198
then click "Finish".

51
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:08,098
The application will now open. Starting

52
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,953
for the first time — in the background,

53
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:12,426
the Node.js server and SQLite

54
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,899
database are being initialized. A loading screen

55
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,372
will appear. Please wait a few seconds.

56
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,845
Since this is a fresh installation,

57
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,317
the Setup Wizard will open. There are five

58
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:24,790
steps — Welcome, Language, Admin

59
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,263
Account, Library Info, and

60
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:30,232
Complete. The first page shows the Government Polytechnic

61
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:32,857
Kampli logo, campus photo, and

62
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,957
library mission. To begin setup,

63
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:37,057
click the "Get Started"

64
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,682
button. The second

65
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,308
step is Personalization. There are three options here.

66
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,933
First, Language — English or Kannada.

67
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,558
All menus, buttons, and

68
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,219
messages in the application will appear in your chosen language.

69
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,801
Second, Appearance — Light Mode

70
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,382
or Dark Mode. Third, Text

71
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,964
Size — Small, Medium, Large, or Extra Large.

72
00:02:57,964 --> 00:03:00,546
All these settings can be changed later

73
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,612
anytime from the Settings page.

74
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:05,194
The third step is the most important — Admin

75
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,776
Account creation. This account will be

76
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,493
the primary administrator with full

77
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,471
access — book management,

78
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:14,448
student registration, staff management,

79
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:17,413
backup, and settings control. Enter your

80
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,379
full name, email address, and a strong

81
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,345
password. The password must be at least six

82
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:26,311
characters long. Remember this password — it will be

83
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:28,288
used for your first login. Click "Continue".

84
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:31,277
The fourth step is Library

85
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,129
Details. The library name is already pre-filled as

86
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,410
"GPT Kampli Library". No need to

87
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,121
change it. Verify that it's correct

88
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,403
and click "Continue".

89
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,684
Setup is now complete! This

90
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,535
page shows a summary of all the details

91
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,387
you entered — admin name, email,

92
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:51,154
selected language, and library

93
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:53,643
name. Click "Go to Login" to proceed

94
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,629
to the login page. Use the admin email

95
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,616
and password you created during setup

96
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,603
to log in. After logging in,

97
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:05,092
the Dashboard will open. From here, you can

98
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,083
manage the book catalog, student registration,

99
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,572
book issue and return, fine

100
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:12,538
management, staff management, backup,

101
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,846
and much more.

102
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:17,154
The Library Management System installation

103
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:19,463
and setup is now complete. If you face any issues,

104
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,771
go to the "System Health" page

105
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:24,656
in the application and use the "Report Bug"

106
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:27,542
button to report directly on GitHub.

107
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,850
Thank you for watching!

108
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,751
Government Polytechnic, Kampli — CS&E Department.
