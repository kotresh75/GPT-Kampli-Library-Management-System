**Problem Statement:**

Most college libraries rely on manual or outdated systems that suffer from data inconsistency, lack of security, and inefficient tracking of books and fines. Furthermore, many existing digital solutions depend on stable internet connectivity and complex infrastructure. There is a specific need for a robust **Desktop Library Management System** that combines the modern interface of a web application with the reliability of a standalone desktop software. This system should ensure secure **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, automate circulation and fine management, provide comprehensive **Audit Logging** for accountability, and support **multi-language interfaces**, ensuring efficient and transparent library operations without heavy infrastructure requirements.

**Objectives:**

1.  To design and implement a secure, **Desktop-based Library Management System** using Electron and modern web technologies (React, Node.js).

2.  To provide strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for Admin and Staff to ensure data security.

3.  To automate book inventory management, including **bulk import**, tracking copies, and department-wise classification.

4.  To implement a **robust circulation system** for issuing and returning books with automated due-date tracking and fine calculation.

5.  To support **multi-language interfaces (i18n)** to make the system accessible to a wider range of users.

6.  To maintain a complete, immutable **Audit Log** of all critical system activities for accountability.

7.  To enable comprehensive **Report Generation** and data export for administrative monitoring.

8.  To ensure the system operates reliably in an **offline-first** environment where consistent internet access may not be available.

9.  To improve the overall efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of library operations.

**Capstone project description:**

The **Desktop-based Library Management System** is a robust cross-platform application developed to automate and manage the operational workflow of a college library. Built using **Electron**, the system combines the modern interface of a web application with the reliability of desktop software. It uses a **local SQLite database** to securely store user information, book records, circulation transactions, fines, and audit logs, ensuring data privacy and offline capability.

The application supports role-based access control, where:

- **Staff** can manage book records, issue and return books, monitor active transactions, and generate circulation-related reports.

- **Admin** has complete control over the system, including user management, system configuration, audit log monitoring, report generation, and data backup operations.

The backend is implemented using **Node.js** and **Express**, while the frontend is developed using **React.js**, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The system improves accuracy, reduces manual workload, and ensures reliable data handling compared to traditional library management methods.

**Main Deliverables**

**Design:**

The Library Management System is designed as a **Desktop-based**, modular architecture that ensures scalability and secure role-based access. The system design separates presentation, application logic, and local data storage.

**Major System Components:**

- **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** Developed using React.js and **Electron** to provide responsive user interfaces for **Admin and Staff** roles.

- **Application Layer (Backend):** Implemented using Node.js and Express.js to handle business logic, internal API services, authentication, authorization, and data processing.

- **Database Layer: SQLite** is used as the local database to store user information, book details, book copies, issue/return transactions, fine records, and audit logs.

- **Authentication and Authorization Module:** Implements secure login, role-based access control, and session management.

- **Circulation and Fine Management Module:** Handles book issuing, returning, due-date tracking, and automatic fine calculation.

- **Reporting and Audit Module:** Generates administrative reports and maintains system activity logs.

The modular design approach allows easy maintenance, future enhancements, and integration of additional features.

**Description of Technology Used:**

**Hardware**

- Desktop or Laptop Computer

- Minimum 4 GB RAM

- **Offline-capable** deployment (Internet optional for updates)

**Software**

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 / Windows 11

- **Frontend Framework:** React.js wrapped in **Electron**

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express.js

- **Database:** **SQLite** (Local File-based)

- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Postman, Git

**Programming Languages**

- **JavaScript:** Frontend and Backend development

All technologies used are **open-source, industry-relevant, and cost-effective**, making the system suitable for academic and real-world applications.

**Fabrication / Construction Details:**

Since the project is a **software-based system**, no physical fabrication is involved. The construction of the application includes:

- Designing user interfaces and system workflows

- Developing frontend components and dashboards

- Implementing backend APIs and business logic

- Creating and integrating the **SQLite** database schema

- Connecting frontend and backend modules

- Configuring authentication and security mechanisms

The system is developed incrementally using an **iterative development approach**, allowing continuous improvement and validation at each stage.

**Testing and Validation:**

Testing and validation are carried out throughout the development lifecycle to ensure system reliability and correctness.

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Individual modules such as authentication, book management, circulation, and fine calculation are tested independently.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Ensures seamless interaction between frontend, backend, and database components.

- **Functional Testing:**  
  Validates all system features including book issue/return, user management, fine calculation, and report generation.

- **Validation:**  
  Confirms that the system meets the defined project objectives, functional requirements, and user expectations.

Defects identified during testing are corrected, and the system is re-tested to ensure stable performance.

**Results and Inference**

The developed **Desktop-based** Library Management System successfully automates core library operations such as book inventory management, user management, circulation activities, fine calculation, and report generation. The system significantly reduces manual effort, improves data accuracy, and enhances operational efficiency.

From the observed results, it is inferred that the system is **reliable, secure, user-friendly, and suitable for offline library management in educational institutions**. The modular and scalable design allows future enhancements based on institutional requirements.
