**ABSTRACT/EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The rapid growth of information technology has transformed the way educational institutions manage academic resources. Libraries, being a core component of learning infrastructure, require efficient systems to manage books, users, and circulation activities. Many college libraries still rely on manual registers or partially computerized methods, which often result in data inconsistency, delayed services, and increased administrative workload.

The Library Management System presented in this capstone project is a desktop-based application developed to streamline and automate essential library operations. The system provides a centralized platform to manage book inventory, user records, issue and return transactions, and fine calculation in an accurate and transparent manner. By digitizing these processes, the system reduces manual effort and minimizes operational errors.

The application is implemented using modern full-stack technologies. The desktop application is built using Electron.js, which combines the reliability of desktop software with modern web technologies. The frontend is developed using React.js to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the backend is built using Node.js and Express.js to handle business logic and secure communication. SQLite is used as the local database to store and manage library data efficiently, ensuring complete offline functionality and data privacy. Role-based access control is implemented to ensure that administrators and library staff can access only the functionalities relevant to their roles.

Key features of the system include automated due-date tracking, real-time availability status of books, secure authentication, barcode scanner integration, audit logging of important system activities, and full offline capability. The project was completed within an academic duration of sixteen weeks following a structured and iterative development approach. Overall, the developed Library Management System demonstrates an effective and economical solution for modernizing library operations in educational institutions.

INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 Introduction**

Libraries play a significant role in supporting academic learning, teaching, and research activities within educational institutions. They provide access to textbooks, reference materials, journals, and other learning resources essential for students and faculty. Effective management of these resources is necessary to ensure timely availability, accurate record keeping, and smooth circulation of books.

In many colleges, library operations are still handled using manual registers or basic digital tools such as spreadsheets. These methods often lead to several challenges, including difficulty in tracking issued books, errors in fine calculation, duplication of records, and lack of real-time information about book availability. Manual processes also increase the workload of library staff and reduce overall operational efficiency.

With the widespread adoption of desktop and digital technologies, there is a growing need to replace traditional library practices with automated systems. A desktop-based Library Management System offers the advantage of local data storage, complete offline functionality, secure access, and real-time updates. Such systems improve accuracy, reduce manual intervention, and enhance transparency in library operations while ensuring data privacy and independence from internet connectivity.

This capstone project focuses on the design and development of a desktop-based Library Management System that automates key library functions such as staff management, book inventory maintenance, student database management, book issue and return processes, fine calculation, and barcode scanner integration. The system is designed to be user-friendly, secure, reliable, and fully functional offline, making it suitable for deployment in academic environments.

By implementing role-based authentication, the system ensures controlled access for administrators and library staff members. Automated workflows, barcode scanning capabilities, and digital records help improve accountability and provide better service to library users. This project demonstrates the practical application of software engineering concepts, desktop application development using Electron.js, and full-stack development techniques to solve a real-world institutional problem.

Table 2.1: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**Major WBS Phases**

**1. Project Initiation and Requirement Analysis**

In this phase, we studied the existing manual and semi-automated library system used in colleges. We identified problems such as difficulty in tracking issued books, manual fine calculation, and lack of centralized records. Based on this study, we defined the problem statement and finalized the objectives of the Library Management System. Functional and non-functional requirements were identified, and the project scope and constraints were clearly documented.

**2. System Design and Architecture**

During this phase, we designed the overall desktop application architecture using Electron.js as the container with a three-tier model consisting of frontend (React.js), backend (Node.js/Express), and database (SQLite) layers. We prepared system flow diagrams and database schema to represent data flow and storage. Module-level design was created for Admin and Staff components to define responsibilities and interactions between modules. Barcode scanner integration architecture was also designed.

**3. Backend Development**

In this phase, we developed the backend of the application using Node.js and Express.js. We implemented authentication and authorization using JWT, user management modules, book and book-copy management, circulation logic for issue and return, fine calculation logic, audit logging, and report generation APIs. All backend services were tested individually to ensure correct functionality.

**4. Database Implementation**

During this phase, we created SQLite database tables for admins, staff, students, departments, books, book copies, circulation records, fines, audit logs, and system settings. We defined relationships between entities using foreign keys and implemented data validation rules. The local SQLite database was successfully integrated with backend services to ensure secure, reliable, and offline-capable data storage and retrieval.

**5. Frontend Development**

In this phase, we developed the user interface using React.js within the Electron framework. We created login screens and role-based dashboards for Admin and Staff users. Forms for data input, tables for data display, barcode scanner input fields, and navigation components were implemented. The frontend was integrated with backend APIs and WebSocket connections to enable real-time interaction with the system.

**6. System Integration and Testing**

During this phase, we integrated the Electron container, frontend, and backend modules into a complete desktop application. Unit testing and integration testing were performed to verify system functionality. We tested book issue and return processes, fine calculation, barcode scanner input, role-based access control, offline functionality, and data synchronization. Identified issues were fixed to improve system stability and performance.

**7. Documentation and Reporting**

In this phase, we prepared detailed project documentation as per DTE guidelines. This included system design explanations, module descriptions, screenshots, test cases, and appendices. Regular updates were made to ensure consistency between implementation and documentation.

**8. Deployment and Submission**

This design ensures modularity, offline functionality, data privacy, and maintainability. The Electron framework enables the application to run as a native Windows desktop application while leveraging modern web technologies.

**2.6.2 Discussion of Alternative Designs**

Alternative designs such as web-based applications and cloud-hosted solutions were considered but rejected due to concerns about internet dependency, data privacy, ongoing hosting costs, and the need for complete offline functionality. The desktop-based approach was chosen to ensure data remains local, the system works without internet connectivity, and there are no recurring cloud service expenses.

**2.6.3 Detailed Description of Components / Subsystems**

- **Admin Module:** Staff management, student management, system configuration, policy settings, audit logs, comprehensive reports, backup and restore

- **Staff Module:** Book catalog management, student registration, circulation operations (issue/return/renew), fine collection, barcode scanning, transaction monitoring, basic reports

- **Database Module:** SQLite local database with optional cloud synchronization to MongoDB Atlas for backup purposes

- **Hardware Integration Module:** Barcode scanner support, receipt printer integration

Each component interacts through secure REST APIs and Socket.io WebSocket connections for real-time updates, following strict role-based access control (RBAC) permissions

**CHAPTER 3  
Approach and Methodology**

This chapter describes the development approach, methodology, tools, and implementation strategy adopted for the Library Management System. A systematic and modular process was followed to ensure that the system was developed within the academic timeline while maintaining functionality, security, usability, and complete offline capability as a desktop application.

**3.1 Development Approach**

The development of the Library Management System followed a structured and iterative approach specifically designed for desktop application development using the Electron.js framework. Instead of building the entire system in a single phase, the application was developed in smaller modules that were designed, implemented, and tested incrementally. This approach helped in identifying issues at an early stage and allowed gradual improvement of system features.

The project execution was divided into phases such as requirement analysis, desktop application architecture design, Electron.js integration, backend development, frontend development within the Electron renderer process, SQLite database implementation, barcode scanner integration, system integration, testing, and documentation. Each phase produced measurable outputs, ensuring steady progress and effective tracking of project activities. Continuous documentation was maintained alongside development to ensure consistency between implementation and reporting.

The desktop-first approach emphasizes:

- Clear requirement definition with focus on offline functionality before development

- Modular design of system components within Electron container

- Local-first data architecture using SQLite for complete offline operation

- Hardware integration planning for barcode scanners and receipt printers

- Incremental development and testing of desktop-specific features

- Continuous documentation alongside implementation

This structured approach helps in minimizing risks, managing time efficiently, maintaining alignment with academic guidelines, and ensuring the system operates reliably without internet connectivity.

**Note:** Students are library members whose records are managed in the system. They receive email notifications about issued books, due dates, and fines but do not have direct access to the system interface. Only Administrators and Library Staff have system login credentials and access to the desktop application.

**3.2 Development Methodology**

A modular development methodology specifically tailored for desktop application development was adopted for this capstone project. The system was developed by dividing functionality into independent modules such as authentication, staff management, student record management, book catalog management, book copy tracking, circulation operations, barcode scanner integration, fine calculation, audit logging, and reporting. Each module was implemented and verified individually before being integrated into the complete Electron.js desktop application.

The Electron.js framework enables the application to run as a native Windows desktop application while leveraging modern web technologies. The architecture consists of two main processes:

- **Main Process**: Runs Node.js/Express.js backend, manages SQLite database connections, handles IPC (Inter-Process Communication), and controls the application window lifecycle.

- **Renderer Process**: Runs React.js frontend, displays user interface, handles user interactions, and communicates with the main process via IPC.

**Figure 3.2: Book Issue Workflow**

    Cart -->|More| Scan
    Cart -->|Done| Process[Update DB<br/>Email<br/>Print]
    Process --> End([Complete])
```

The methodology involves the following stages:

1.  **Requirement Analysis**  
    Understanding the existing manual library system, identifying functional and non-functional requirements specific to desktop deployment, defining project scope with emphasis on offline functionality, and documenting hardware requirements including barcode scanner specifications.

2.  **Desktop Application Architecture Design**  
    Designing the Electron.js container architecture, planning main process and renderer process separation, designing SQLite database schema with proper indexing for performance, creating data flow diagrams for IPC communication, and planning barcode scanner input handling mechanisms.

3.  **Implementation**  
    Developing backend services within Electron main process using Node.js and Express.js, creating frontend interfaces within Electron renderer process using React.js, implementing SQLite database operations with proper transaction management, integrating barcode scanner hardware via USB HID protocol, and developing all modules in parallel wherever possible to optimize development time.

4.  **Testing and Validation**  
    Verifying each module individually through unit testing, conducting integration testing to verify interaction between Electron main and renderer processes, testing barcode scanner hardware integration with actual scanning devices, validating offline functionality by disconnecting internet, testing SQLite database integrity and backup mechanisms, and verifying the complete system as an integrated desktop application.

5.  **Documentation and Review**  
    Preparing detailed project documentation including system architecture diagrams, database schema documentation, API endpoint specifications, barcode scanner integration guides, and reviewing system performance metrics including application startup time, database query performance, and memory usage.

This methodology ensures flexibility, improved quality, better handling of changes during development, and successful delivery of a fully functional offline-capable desktop application.

**3.3 Technology Stack**

The Library Management System was developed as a desktop application using modern technologies that support offline operation, local data storage, hardware integration, and ease of maintenance.

**Desktop Container**

Electron.js framework was selected as the desktop application container. It enables the development of cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies while providing native operating system integration, local file system access for SQLite database, and hardware device communication capabilities for barcode scanners and printers.

**Frontend Technologies**

React.js was used to develop the user interface within the Electron renderer process. Its component-based architecture enabled the creation of reusable UI elements and improved maintainability. Separate dashboards were designed for administrators and library staff with role-based access control to enhance usability and security. The interface includes support for barcode scanner input, real-time updates via Socket.io, and accessibility features including high contrast mode and font scaling.

**Backend Technologies**

Node.js served as the server-side runtime environment within the Electron main process, while Express.js was used to build RESTful APIs for internal communication. The backend handles authentication using JWT tokens, authorization through role-based access control (RBAC), business logic for circulation operations and fine calculations, SQLite database operations, barcode scanner input processing, and communication with the frontend via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms.

**Database**

SQLite was selected as the database solution due to its serverless architecture, zero-configuration requirements, complete offline functionality, and efficient handling of structured data. The SQLite database is stored locally on the file system and contains all system data including admin accounts, staff accounts, student records, department information, book catalog, book copies with unique accession numbers, circulation transactions, fine records, audit logs, and system settings. This local-first approach ensures the system operates fully offline without any internet dependency for core operations.

**Optional Cloud Backup**

MongoDB Atlas is optionally used for cloud backup and disaster recovery purposes only. It is not the primary database. The system can synchronize local SQLite data to MongoDB Atlas when internet connectivity is available, providing an additional layer of data protection. This feature is completely optional and the system functions fully without it.

**Hardware Integration**

The system integrates with USB barcode scanners using HID (Human Interface Device) protocol for rapid book identification during circulation operations. Barcode scanner input is treated as keyboard input and processed in real-time. The system also supports thermal receipt printers (58mm/80mm ESC/POS compatible) for printing transaction receipts and standard laser/inkjet printers for generating reports and student ID cards.

**Security Mechanisms**

JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms were implemented to ensure secure access to system resources. User passwords are hashed using bcrypt algorithm before storage. Session management is handled through JWT tokens stored in localStorage. All critical operations are logged in audit logs with timestamps in IST (Indian Standard Time) format.

**Real-time Communication**

Socket.io was integrated to provide real-time updates across the application. When circulation transactions occur, dashboard statistics update automatically without page refresh. This enhances user experience and ensures staff always see current information.

**Development Tools**

- Visual Studio Code for code development and debugging

- Git for version control and collaboration

- Electron Builder for packaging the desktop application into Windows installer

- Postman for API endpoint testing during development

- SQLite Browser for database schema design and verification

**3.4 System Architecture Approach**

The system follows a **desktop-based three-tier architecture** encapsulated within an Electron.js container, which separates concerns and improves maintainability while ensuring complete offline functionality.

1.  **Presentation Layer (Electron Renderer Process)**  
    Handles user interaction through the desktop interface developed using React.js. This layer runs in the Electron renderer process and communicates with the application layer via IPC (Inter-Process Communication). It includes dashboards for administrators and staff, forms for data entry, tables for data display, barcode scanner input handling, and real-time updates via Socket.io.

2.  **Application Layer (Electron Main Process)**  
    Contains backend logic implemented using Node.js and Express.js running in the Electron main process. This layer manages authentication and authorization, implements business logic for circulation operations and fine calculations, handles SQLite database operations, processes barcode scanner input, manages hardware integration for printers, and coordinates IPC communication with the presentation layer.

3.  **Data Layer (Local File System)**  
    Manages persistent data storage using SQLite database stored as a local file on the Windows file system. This ensures complete offline operation, fast query performance, zero network latency, and data privacy. The database includes tables for admins, staff, students, departments, books, book_copies, circulation records, fines, audit_logs, and system_settings.

This architecture ensures loose coupling between components, allows independent modification of each layer, provides complete offline functionality without internet dependency, enables local data storage for privacy and security, and supports hardware integration for barcode scanners and printers.

**3.5 Use Case-Based Implementation**

Students are library members whose records are maintained in the system database. They do not have system access or login credentials. Students receive automated email notifications about book issues, due dates, returns, and fines, but they interact with the library through staff members, not directly through the system interface. Only Administrators and Library Staff have access to the desktop application.

This approach ensures that system development remains user-centric, aligned with real-world library operations, and maintains proper separation between system operators (Admin and Staff) and library patrons (Students).

Figure F.1: Barcode Scanner Integration Diagram

**Hardware Requirements**

- USB barcode scanner (1D or 2D)
- USB HID (Human Interface Device) protocol support
- Keyboard emulation mode (standard feature)

**Working Principle**

Barcode scanners operate in **keyboard emulation mode**, meaning scanned values are entered as keyboard input directly into the active input field.

**Integration in Desktop Application**

1. **Barcode Encoding:**
   - ISBN encoded as barcode on book labels
   - Accession number encoded as barcode on book copy labels
   - Student register number can be encoded for quick lookup

2. **Scanning Process:**
   - Staff focuses on the barcode input field in the application
   - Staff scans the barcode using USB scanner
   - Scanner sends barcode value as keyboard input
   - React input field captures the value
   - Main process validates and processes the barcode via IPC
   - Book/student details auto-populated

3. **Supported Operations:**
   - Book issue: Scan student ID → Scan book ISBN/accession number
   - Book return: Scan book ISBN/accession number
   - Student lookup: Scan student register number
   - Book search: Scan ISBN

**Advantages**

- **Faster transactions:** Reduces manual typing time
- **Reduced errors:** Eliminates manual entry mistakes
- **Plug-and-play:** No driver installation required (USB HID standard)
- **Low cost:** USB barcode scanners available for ₹2,000-₹5,000
- **Easy training:** Staff can learn in minutes

**Implementation Notes**

- No additional middleware or backend code required
- Standard HTML input fields capture scanner input
- Barcode format: Code 128, Code 39, or QR Code
- Scanner configured to add Enter key after scan (auto-submit)

This approach ensures practical deployment without increasing system complexity.

**Appendix G: Thermal Printer Integration**

The system supports **thermal receipt printer integration** for printing transaction receipts.

Figure G.1: Thermal Printer Integration Diagram

**Hardware Requirements**

- Thermal receipt printer (58mm or 80mm)
- USB or Bluetooth connectivity
- ESC/POS command support (industry standard)

**Working Principle**

The desktop application sends **ESC/POS commands** to the thermal printer via USB or Bluetooth connection.

**Integration in Desktop Application**

1. **Printer Detection:**
   - Main process detects connected USB/Bluetooth printers
   - Lists available printers in settings

2. **Receipt Generation:**
   - Transaction data formatted as receipt text
   - ESC/POS commands added for formatting (bold, alignment, cut)
   - Main process sends commands to printer

3. **Receipt Types:**
   - **Issue Receipt:** Student name, book title, issue date, due date
   - **Return Receipt:** Student name, book title, return date, fine amount
   - **Fine Receipt:** Student name, fine amount, payment date, receipt number

**Advantages**

- **Professional receipts:** Printed receipts for students
- **Record keeping:** Physical proof of transactions
- **Fast printing:** Thermal printers print in seconds
- **Low cost:** Thermal printers available for ₹3,000-₹8,000
- **No ink required:** Thermal paper only

**Implementation Notes**
