**Status**

System architecture and database schema were designed. A three-tier architecture was finalized with Electron as the desktop container, React for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend, and SQLite for local database. Complete Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and database schema were prepared covering all entities: departments, students, staff, admins, books, book_copies, circulation, fines, transaction_logs, and system_settings.

**Highlights**

- Three-tier architecture finalized: Electron + React + Node.js + SQLite

- Complete database schema designed with 12+ tables

- Local-first, offline-capable architecture confirmed

- Technology stack documented: Electron v40.0, React v19, Node.js Latest, SQLite3 v5.x
